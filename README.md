A native macOS menubar app showing real-time upload and download rates, router-wide bandwidth, historical traffic statistics, and built-in speed testing.

Latest release: **NetFluss 2.3**

## New in 2.3

- **Wi-Fi manager in the popover** — see every nearby Wi-Fi network, switch with a click, pin SSIDs to the top of the list, and have temporarily out-of-range pinned networks stay visible until you unpin them. Passwords entered through NetFluss are written into macOS's Known Networks via the privileged helper, so the standard macOS Wi-Fi menu will reuse them later — even if NetFluss isn't running. Especially handy on travel or in environments with many SSIDs.

- **Customisable popover sections** — Preferences → Appearance now lets you drag the popover segments (Download / Upload, Network adapters, Network flow, DNS, Router, Wi-Fi Networks, Top Apps) into any order you like, and tick or untick each section right from the reorder list. The visibility toggles stay in sync with the existing per-section toggles elsewhere in Preferences.

</p>

- **Wi-Fi settings pane** — new Preferences → Wi-Fi pane with a toggle to enable the section and an option to cap the list to the strongest N networks (pinned and currently-connected networks always show). Preferences → General now also exposes one-click buttons to grant Location access and install the privileged helper, so the user never has to hunt for the right pane in System Settings.

- **Fix for Macs whose download counter stayed at 0.00** — on macOS 26.5 the kernel's `ifi_ibytes` counter is frozen on the active physical Wi-Fi / Ethernet adapter for some configurations (often Macs with a managed profile or specific NetworkExtension-based security software). NetFluss now detects that and substitutes a per-process inbound rate from `nettop` so both the menu-bar number and the Bandwidth Statistics history record correctly. Auto-pauses the helper subprocess when no real traffic is happening, so unaffected Macs see no extra CPU usage.

## Features

### Menubar

- Live upload ↑ and download ↓ rates displayed in the menu bar
- Four menu bar styles: Standard, Unified pill, Dashboard, and Icon
- Separate color choices for upload arrow, download arrow, upload number, and download number
- Monospaced digits for stable layout
- Configurable font size (8–16 pt), font style (Monospaced / System / Rounded), pinned unit, and decimal precision
- **Icon mode** — switch to a single symbol in the menu bar and choose between multiple icon options, including the NetFluss app-style icon
- **Launch at login** — toggle in Preferences → Launch

### Popover

- **Header** — total Download and Upload rates shown prominently at the top
- **Adapter cards** — each active network interface as a card with:
  - SF Symbol icon for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or other adapters
  - Link speed badge (Wi-Fi TX rate or Ethernet speed)
  - Per-card DL/UL rates with coloured arrows
  - Wi-Fi frequency band (2.4 GHz / 5 GHz / 6 GHz) or "Ethernet"
  - ↺ reconnect button — cycles the adapter off and back on (Wi-Fi: no password needed; Ethernet: approved via the NetFluss helper)
  - ℹ️ **Wi-Fi detail popover** — click the (i) button on any Wi-Fi card to see: Standard (e.g. Wi-Fi 6 / 802.11ax), Security (WPA3 Personal, etc.), Channel & Width, RSSI, Noise, SNR, ESSID, BSSID (with copy), and Tx Rate
- **IP addresses** — two display modes:
  - **List view** — External, Internal, and Router IP, each with a one-click copy button
  - **Connection flow view** — visual network path from your Mac through the router (and VPN, if active) to the internet, with country flag for VPN exit nodes
- **DNS Switcher** — switch between DNS providers directly from the popover (enable in Preferences):
  - Built-in presets: System Default, Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS
  - Add your own custom DNS presets with up to four DNS servers
  - Shows the currently active DNS with a green checkmark
  - Built on a bundled privileged helper for reliable DNS changes and Ethernet resets
- **Wi-Fi Switcher** — list nearby Wi-Fi networks and join them from the popover (enable in Preferences):
  - Tap a known network to join silently; new secured networks prompt for a password
  - Successful joins are written into macOS's Known Networks via the privileged helper, so the system Wi-Fi menu reuses the password later — even if NetFluss isn't running
  - **Pin SSIDs** to the top of the list; pinned networks stay visible (marked "Not available") even when out of range, and a tap re-triggers a targeted scan to try reconnecting
  - **(i) details** popover per row showing band, channel, RSSI, security, BSSID
  - Optional "only show the N strongest" cap so the list stays short in crowded environments
- **Router Bandwidth** — shows total WAN download/upload rates from supported routers:
  - **Fritz!Box** via TR-064 API
  - **UniFi** via the UniFi OS / controller REST API
  - **OpenWRT** via the ubus JSON-RPC API
  - **OPNsense** via the OPNsense REST API
- **Top Apps** — optional section listing the top 5 processes by current network traffic, with a relative usage bar per app (enable in Preferences)
  - **Live updates while visible** — app traffic refreshes live while the popup or pinned window is open
  - **App filtering** — hide noisy background processes (e.g. mDNSResponder) from the list via Preferences or hover to hide directly
- **Pin button** — turn the popup into a movable floating window so NetFluss can stay open like a live widget
- **Scrollable popover** — the popover is scrollable and resizable for smaller screens, preventing overflow when many adapters or sections are active
- **Edge-aware popover positioning** — keeps the popover fully visible when the menu bar icon sits near the left or right screen border
- **Footer** — quick access to Preferences, About, and Quit

### Statistics

- Dedicated statistics window with `1H`, `24H`, `7D`, `30D`, and `1Y` ranges
- Download and upload timelines, top adapters, and top apps
- Historical bandwidth analysis by adapter and by app
- Top adapter ranking with automatic `Other` grouping when many interfaces are active
- Top 10 apps for download and upload over each selected range
- Minute-level detail for the `1H` view
- Optional app statistics collection with energy-conscious background sampling
- Demo/sample data mode for previewing the interface before real history accumulates
- Improved app attribution for Safari/WebKit traffic and more reliable adapter accounting for LAN/NAS transfers

### Speed Test

- Dedicated speed test window launched from the menu bar icon context menu
- Integrated M-Lab and Cloudflare speed tests
- Download, upload, latency, jitter, and server details in a dedicated window
- Provider selector remembered between runs
- Right-click the menu bar icon to start a test instantly
- Speed test history can be opened without automatically starting a new test
- Persistent speed test history stored locally on the Mac
- Notes field for each saved result, useful for remembering where or why the test was taken
- Compact locale-aware timestamps in speed test history

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or later
- Xcode 15+ or Swift 5.10+ toolchain (to build from source)

## Install

Download `NetFluss-2.3.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/rana-gmbh/NetFluss/releases/latest), unzip it, and move `NetFluss.app` to `/Applications`.

NetFluss is notarized and signed with a Developer ID certificate, so Gatekeeper should clear it automatically on first launch.

You can also use Homebrew to install NetFluss:

```bash
brew install --cask rana-gmbh/netfluss/netfluss
```

## Build from source

```bash
swift build -c release
```

Or open `Package.swift` in Xcode and run the executable scheme.

## Notes

- Wi-Fi SSID and band use CoreWLAN. macOS may prompt for Location Services permission to expose SSID details.
- Ethernet link speed is read from `ifi_baudrate` and may show `—` when unavailable.
- External IP is fetched from `ipwho.is` (with `api.ipify.org` as fallback).
- Popup Top Apps uses live per-process sampling while visible; historical app statistics can be enabled separately in Preferences.
- DNS changes and Ethernet resets in the packaged app use the bundled NetFluss helper and may require one-time system approval.
- OpenWRT monitoring expects ubus access to be available on the router; a manual host can help when auto-detection resolves to a different gateway.
- OPNsense monitoring requires API credentials created in OPNsense and can use a manually configured host when auto-detection points to another router.
- Speed test adapter pinning is not implemented yet; tests currently follow the default active route.
